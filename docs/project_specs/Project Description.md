## ❓ Problem Statement

Managing personal finances effectively is a critical challenge faced by individuals worldwide. Traditional budgeting methods are often static and fail to account for seasonal variations, lifestyle changes, and unexpected expenses.

Many people struggle to predict future expenses accurately, leading to overspending, insufficient savings, and financial stress.

This project aims to develop a **machine learning and deep learning-based forecasting system** that predicts personal expenses across different categories (housing, food, transportation, entertainment, etc.) using:

* Historical spending patterns
* Seasonal trends
* External economic factors

The solution will include:

* A robust forecasting model
* Budget optimization recommendations
* An interactive **Streamlit app** for visualization and personalized insights

---

## 💼 Business Use Cases

* **Personal Finance Management** → Plan monthly budgets effectively & avoid overspending
* **Financial Planning Services** → Advisors can give tailored recommendations
* **Banking Applications** → Banks integrate forecasts into mobile apps
* **Expense Management Apps** → Add predictive insights to fintech apps
* **Insurance & Loan Services** → Assess spending patterns for credit/risk evaluation

---

## 🛠️ Approach

### 📂 Data Collection

* **User-Collected Transaction Data** → Bank statements, credit card bills, UPI/Wallet exports (Paytm, Google Pay, PhonePe)
* **Kaggle Datasets** → `personal-expense-transaction-data`, other financial datasets
* **Hybrid Dataset** → Merge Kaggle + user data for diversity
* **Data Cleaning & Formatting** → Standardize into:

```text
user_id | date | category | merchant | amount | income/expense | demographics
```

---

### 🧹 Data Preprocessing

* Categorize expenses (NLP on merchant descriptions)
* Handle missing values, duplicates, outliers
* Create time-based features: day of week, month, season, holidays

---

### 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Category-wise & time-based spending trends
* Detect seasonality and cycles
* Correlate income & demographics with spending

---

### 🏗️ Feature Engineering

* Lag features, rolling averages, moving windows
* Category-specific ratios & volatility measures
* External indicators → inflation, interest rates, fuel prices

---

### 🤖 Modeling

**Baseline Models**

* Linear Regression
* ARIMA / SARIMA
* Facebook Prophet

**Machine Learning Models**

* Random Forest Regressor
* XGBoost
* LightGBM

**Deep Learning Models**

* LSTM, GRU, Bi-LSTM
* 1D CNNs for local trend detection

**Transformer-Based Models (Advanced)**

* Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT)
* N-BEATS, Autoformer

**Ensemble Methods**

* Combine ML + DL for robust performance

---

### 📏 Evaluation

* Metrics: MAE, RMSE, MAPE, Directional Accuracy
* Compare ML vs DL vs Transformers
* Validate **per category** (housing, food, etc.)
* Forecast horizons: **1, 3, 6 months**

---

### 🚀 Deployment

* **Streamlit App** → Dashboards, visualizations, forecast reports
* **Budget Optimization Module** → Suggest category limits
* Export reports → Excel/PDF

---

## 🏆 Results

By the end of the project, the system will deliver:

* **Processed Financial Dataset** (Kaggle + personal data)
* **Comprehensive EDA** with professional visualizations
* **Advanced Forecasting Models** (LSTM/GRU, Transformers) with **<15% MAPE**
* **Interactive Streamlit Application** → Forecasting, budgeting, financial scoring
* **Performance Benchmarks** → ML vs DL vs Transformer comparison

---
