# 🗺️ Roadmap – BudgetWise: AI-based Expense Forecasting Tool

---

## 📌 Phase 1: Setup & Data (Week 1–2)

### 🔧 Environment Setup

* Python (3.9+)
* Jupyter / VS Code
* Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`, `tensorflow/pytorch`, `prophet`, `xgboost`, `streamlit`
* Setup **GitHub repo** for version control

### 📂 Data Collection

* Gather **personal transaction data** (bank exports, CSVs, UPI/wallet data).
* Download Kaggle datasets: *personal-expense-transaction-data*, *financial datasets*.
* Merge into a unified dataset:

```text
user_id | date | category | merchant | amount | income/expense | demographics
```

### 🧹 Data Preprocessing

* Parse dates → `year`, `month`, `day`, `weekday`.
* Categorize merchants (food, rent, travel, shopping).
* Handle **missing values, duplicates, outliers**.
* Normalize currency if required.

---

## 📌 Phase 2: Exploration & Features (Week 2–3)

### 📊 EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

* Category-wise spend (pie charts, bar graphs).
* Seasonal patterns (monthly, weekly spending).
* Correlation with income/demographics.

### 🏗️ Feature Engineering

* Lag features (previous month spend).
* Rolling averages (3-month moving spend).
* Expense ratios (category spend / income).
* External indicators (inflation, interest rates).

---

## 📌 Phase 3: Modeling (Week 3–6)

### ⚡ Baseline Models (Quick Start)

* Linear Regression
* ARIMA
* Prophet

### 🤖 Machine Learning Models

* Random Forest
* XGBoost
* LightGBM (with engineered features)

### 🧠 Deep Learning Models

* LSTM, GRU, Bi-LSTM → sequential dependencies
* CNN-1D → local trend detection

### 🔮 Advanced Transformer Models *(optional, for excellence)*

* Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT)
* N-BEATS / Autoformer (Hugging Face Time Series)

### 📏 Evaluation

* Metrics: **MAE, RMSE, MAPE, Directional Accuracy**
* Compare **short-term (1 month)** vs **mid-term (3–6 months)** performance
* Select **best-performing model**

---

## 📌 Phase 4: Application (Week 6–7)

### 🖥️ Streamlit Application Development

* File upload for CSV/Excel
* Dashboard:

  * Spending breakdown (bar/pie charts)
  * Forecasted expenses (line charts)
  * Budget optimization recommendations

### ⚙️ Optional API Development

* REST API with **Flask/FastAPI**
* Endpoints: `/forecast`, `/budget`, `/upload`

---

## 📌 Phase 5: Testing & Deployment (Week 7–8)

### 🧪 Testing

* Unit tests for data preprocessing
* Model validation across categories
* App testing for multiple users/data

### 🚀 Deployment

* Deploy **Streamlit app** → Streamlit Cloud / Heroku / AWS
* **Dockerize** for portability
* Add **README + User Guide**

### 📝 Documentation & Presentation

* Technical report: methodology, EDA, models, results
* Performance benchmarks (**ML vs DL vs Transformer**)
* Future scope: real-time integration, anomaly detection

---

## 🔹 MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

👉 Goal: Deliver a **simplified but functional** version in ~2–3 weeks

### ✅ MVP Features

* CSV upload by users
* Automated preprocessing (categories + dates)
* EDA dashboard:

  * Total spend by category
  * Monthly spending trends
* Forecasting model (Prophet/ARIMA)
* 3-month forecast visualization
* Simple budget recommendations (e.g., “reduce dining by 10% to save ₹X”)

### 🛠️ MVP Tech Stack

* **Backend**: Python + scikit-learn / Prophet
* **Frontend**: Streamlit dashboard
* **Data Input**: CSV upload
* **Output**: Charts + recommendations

---

## 🔹 Final Expanded Version (Post-MVP)

After MVP, expand into:

* Multiple models (LSTM, GRU, XGBoost, Transformers)
* Budget optimization algorithm (category-based allocation)
* Multi-user support (database integration)
* REST API service
* Cloud deployment with Docker

---

🔥 This roadmap provides a clear **step-by-step timeline** for building, testing, and deploying BudgetWise from MVP to full-fledged application.
